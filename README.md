# TRIAD Framework

**Relational Syntaxis (RS) · Epistemological Special Relativity of Measurement Agents (ESRM) · Epistemic Measurement Dynamics (EMD)**

This repository hosts the canonical research corpus of the TRIAD framework, a formally constrained epistemic architecture addressing meaning, measurement, and authority in multi-intelligence environments.

## Scope

The TRIAD framework develops:
- **RS** — meaning as relational coherence across heterogeneous channels
- **ESRM** — conditional epistemic invariants across measurement agents
- **EMD** — measurement as epistemic action with irreversible effects

Applications include AI governance, irreversible records, and non-dominating institutional design.
